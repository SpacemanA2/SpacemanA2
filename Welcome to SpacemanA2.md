I am spacemanA2 and I love space and making shortcuts like 
[help me do stuff](https://github.com/SpacemanA2/Help-me-do-stuff-shortcut)
# help me do stuff has been abandon for years!
I have abandoned help me do stuff, I have a version ready since like maybe 2023/2024, I could go check. But I do not feel like it at the moment! but because exporting the shortcut as everyone only lets me have one version, it is broken. I will not update it!
